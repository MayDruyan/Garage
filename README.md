# Garage

## Project Description:
An OOP programming academic project. Its purpose is to create a car garage that allows the user to enter his vehicle to the garage, check its status, inflate the wheels and refuel. 
Currently the UI of the garage is implemented using the console.

## Further Ideas:
- Implement UI other than the console
- Add more options to the garage (fix issues)
- Add an option to add the problem's description if it is different than the offered options.
- Give the user a price proposal before fixing the vehicle
- Use a DB so the data will be safe when the program shuts down
